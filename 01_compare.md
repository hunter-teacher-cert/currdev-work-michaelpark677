I teach both the Fundamentals of Computer Science and the AP CSP curriculums written by ProjectStem.org, which is a prepackaged curriculum. I haven't used any other curriculums, so I will just compare these two courses.
The major differences between these two courses are the Fundamentals course focuses on Python for the entire year whereas AP CSP starts with Scratch, then transitions to Python. Therefore, Python is taught only for one month in the AP CSP course, but more much succinctly.
There is much more emphasis on psuedocode in the AP CSP course, which is independent of the programming language.
The similarities between the two courses is the structure of the lessons. There are lesson videos, code-along examples, practice exercises, quizzes, tests, and projects.
Both curriculum also introduce the EarSketch platform, so students can create their own music.
Both give a very good introduction to the main concepts of programming (sequencing, selection, iteration) as well as other topics like the internet, networks, etc.

The strength of the Fundamentals course is that the students have a very good basic understanding of Python, whereas the strength of the AP CSP course is that it exposes
students to both block-based and text-based programming languages.
However, these reasons can also be seen as their weaknesses. Students in the Fundamentals course are thrust straight into a text-based environment, and the AP CSP students
are only exposed to Python for a month. Many students have complained that they would've like to have seen more Python and less Scratch.
