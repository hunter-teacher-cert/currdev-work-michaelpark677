Assignment #1:

Team-Building Assignment (First Week of School)
"Bricktionary" (15 minutes. Students are in groups of 4-5)
Have students play one round of Bricktionary.  
Similar to Pictionary, students will draw a card from the stack without showing the word to their teammates. 
Then using bricks, students will build the object while teammates try to guess what it is. 
Game is over when everyone has had a turn.
Cards are labeled as follows: (8 cards)
Truck, Place, Bridge, TV, Flower, Tree, Boat, House.

Assignment #2:

Basic Robotic Movements (45 minutes, pairs)
Materials:
EV3 Robots
Laptops
Tape
Miniature figures

Station #1:
Have students create a program that will make the robot drive along the lines on the floor
marked by tape but not hit the figures at the end of the lines. Students must create programs
that will control the movement of the robot precisely.

Station #2:
Have students create a program that will move the robot along a square drawn with tape of the floor.
Students must ensure the robots move precisely along the sides of the square and make accurate turns at the
corners of the square.

Have students answer the following questions in their journals:
They should be able to answer questions verbally and in their journals.
● How does the program work? ● What do the different program blocks do? Keep the robots built and have students reflect in their journals: 
● What was easy about this challenge? 
● What was difficult about this challenge? 
● What did I learn from this challenge?
