For my Introduction to CS course, I would consider introducing a language like SNAP into the curriculum at the beginning of the course.
I believe block-based languages are a good launching point to learn coding. So many issues like syntax and logical errors are
erased with block-based programming. Also, memorizing code/vocabulary is a non-issue. This is how our AP CSP course is designed.
We start with Scratch, then move onto Python. Likewise, the Intro to CS class could benefit from this type of track.
SNAP looks like it is very similar to SCRATCh in that you move blocks into main programming environment, then execute them using event blocks
just clicking on the blocks.
I believe the level of syntax is 3. All of the blocks are written with words and phrases that is very easy for the user to understand, and
the blocks are shaped such that blocks that can be logically put together will fit.
As I mentioned above the greatest strengths of Scratch and Snap, I would utilize block-based programming at the beginning of the course, then move
them into text-based programming. This is because when the programs get more complicated and involved, it becomes very cumbersome to nest multiple
blocks into one another. It starts to look like a big complicated mess. Text-based programming languages like Python or Java are much more
economical and to the point when it comes to the code.
I selected SNAP because it is very similar to Scratch, so I wouldn't have a trememdously difficult time learning a new language.
The learning curve would hopefully be pretty short.
