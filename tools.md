I use my PC computer attached to the smartboard to teach my lessons and display my computer screen for my students to see. I use this tool for all of my classes,
including both Fundamentals of Python classes, both AP CSP classes, and the Precalculus Scholars class. I use projectstem.org for the CS classes and khanacademy.org
for my math class. Students can do all of their work on the projectstem.org platform, from watching videos, all readings, lesson practices, coding practices, quizzes,
tests, and projects.
The math class do all of their practice problems, quizzes, and tests on KA.
I chose these platforms because they provide a very easily accessible and all-in-one environment where students don't have to worry about jumping from one platform
to another, like github and repl.it. it is much less confusing and students can see the entire curriculum and where they are in it.
Students can elect to get ahead in the course if they choose to, creating a much more differentiated instruction.
