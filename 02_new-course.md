New CS Course

 If I could create a new computer science course in my school, I would create one that would be geared towards our freshman and sophomore students,
introducing them to CS in a more project-based approach. Currently, both of our CS courses are only offered to juniors and seniors as math elective
courses. They are required to have completed Algebra 1, 2 and Geometry in order to be elegible to take the courses. The Fundamentals course is
a one year course in Python programming and the AP CSP course curriculum is very structured course leading to the AP exam.
  
  I would create this course as a fun and engaging entry-point course for students to tinker around just as some students do using Scratch and LEGO robots
back in elementary and middle school. I would focus on the fundamental concepts of programming structure, using a more visual and hands-on approach.
Students get amazed when their creations not just work on the screen, but when it physically moves and makes sounds.It would be lead-in course for more
text-based coures like Python course or the AP CSP course. 

  The course projects could be making a games and animations using Scratch, exploring howautonomous vehicles are programming using the LEGO EV3, 
and even including a unit on programming arduinos with some basic materials like cardboard or fabrics to create different animated creatures.
